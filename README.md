# JavaScript/TypeScript Playground

This is meant to be used as a playground for testing ideas in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It includes a configured version of the [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner) plugin allowing for quick tests of code snippets outside of any project code.

## Setup Instructions / Requirements

This project runs in a [`devcontainer`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) and requires the following pieces of software to be installed and configured.

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - _Other IDE's coming later as the specification is being open sourced._
